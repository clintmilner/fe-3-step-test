1) What have you learnt in the way of web development in the past month? 
Currently I have been experimenting with the Gulp.js build system and working on a template of files and directories that I can pull down
and start development locally in a matter of minutes.



2) Make the following array duplicate, attached the duplicated values onto the end;
                var array = ["a","b","c",1,2,3,4,5]; 

array.concat( array );



3) How would you optimise the following?
        $(array).each(function(data){
            $("body").append(data);
        });

var $body = $( 'body' ),
    arrayString;

for( var i = 0; i < array.length; i++ )
{
    arrayString += array[i];
}
$body.append( arrayString );



4) What will be shown to the user?
var array = ["a","b","c",1,2,3];
alert(array[2]);

c



5) What is the use or are some uses of data attributes in HTML?
Data attributes provide a way to attach more information to an HTML element which could be used as metadata within a function,
or a data attribute can also have an event listener attached to it using Javascript.



6) What would be your process in analysing and fixing a front-end bug (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in production? What tools or process would you use?
After listening/reading about the bug, I would try to recreate in a browser, or preferably multiple browsers. I would look at a Javascript console
next to see if there are any errors or warnings that might be picked up by the browser. I'd also check the HTML to make sure that the
JS and CSS files have been included correctly and that the browser is returning a 200 code for every file. CSS bugs can be troubleshooted using
the inspector, and 'debugger', 'alert' or 'console' messages can be used in the Javascript.


7) How would you target a device with a screen size of 600px and below? 
Adding a screen media query in the CSS:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)


8) Does the following trigger a HTML request?                
<div style="display:none;">
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>

Yes, the image source will attempt to download even if its parent element will be hidden on the page.



9) Describe the differences between feature detection and using the UA string
Feature Detection is usually done by a library it checks to see if a specific method exists in a browser.
UA String analysis is an older way of trying to determine which browser is being used. It doesn't tell you
if a browser has a certain feature.



10) Explain what this CSS selector is doing  
[role=navigation] > p a:not([href^=mailto]){}

This CSS selector will target direct children of the element that has the ARIA tag of role=navigation. These
children will be a <p> tag surrounding an <a> tag, but only anchor tags that DON'T have a mailto href will be targeted.
